# ACA-PAT-Checker
PAT checker

Simple Perl script for checking PATRISTOCRATs for the ACA magazine Cryptogram prior to publication.

The script carries out the following checks:

1. PAT within agree lengths, will report error if too or too long.
2. Number of singleton letters - will report error if more than 5.
3. The Crib exists and that it matches the endcoded crib provided.
4. The Plaintext and Cipher text matches.

Note:  This could also be used to check ARISTOCRATs too..
